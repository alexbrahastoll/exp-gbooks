A simple command-line utility to search the Google Books API.

Developed by Alex Braha Stoll as part of Reedsy's Engineer Evaluation. You can see the answers
for the other questions [here](https://gist.github.com/alexbrahastoll/3b5ccc192936b14c9716914412cf65cc).

## Usage

First, clone this repo.

Then, install the gems by running `bundle install`.

**Important: as instructed, no gems were used for the actual solution of the challenge.
The only gem used was RSpec, since this is the testing framework I am most familiar with.**

To run the specs, execute `bundle exec rspec`.

Finally, run the executable with `bin/gbooks "your search query"` from within the repo's
root folder.
